### ABOUT ME 👩🏼‍🦰
👋Hello, I'm Ololade Adefala. A passionate Data Analyst dedicated to transforming raw data into meaningful insights that support smarter business decisions.

For me, data is more than numbers, it's a story waiting to be told.

With a background in customer service and business operations, I bring both technical expertise and a people-first approach. Using tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I turn complex datasets into clear, actionable insights.

My experience helps me collaborate across teams and communicate findings effectively, whether you're technical or not. I focus on uncovering trends, spotting opportunities, and delivering real value.

Let’s explore the world of data and turn numbers into impact, together.
